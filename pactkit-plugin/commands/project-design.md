# Command: Design (v22.0 Product Designer)
- **Usage**: `/project-design "$ARGUMENTS"`
- **Agent**: Product Designer

> **PURPOSE**: Transform a product vision into a comprehensive PRD, decompose it into
> implementable Specs, and populate the Sprint Board — bridging the gap between
> "I have an idea" and "I have a prioritized backlog ready for `/project-sprint`."

## 🧠 Phase 0: The Thinking Process (Mandatory)
> **INSTRUCTION**: Output a `<thinking>` block.
1.  **Parse Vision**: What is the core product idea? What problem does it solve?
2.  **Identify Domain**: E-commerce, SaaS, internal tool, mobile app, CLI, etc.
3.  **Detect Stack Hints**: Does the user mention specific technologies? (React, Python, Go, etc.)
4.  **Scope Assessment**: Is this a full product or a module within an existing system?

## 🎬 Phase 1: PRD Generation
> **Goal**: Create `docs/product/prd.md` — the single source of truth for the product.

1.  **Scaffold**: Run `python3 ~/.claude/skills/pactkit-scaffold/scripts/scaffold.py create_prd "{ProductName}"`.
2.  **Fill Sections** — Complete each section in the PRD:

### 1.1 Product Overview
- **Vision**: One-sentence product vision statement
- **Problem Statement**: What pain point does this solve? For whom?
- **Target Users**: Primary and secondary user segments

### 1.2 User Personas (minimum 2)
For each persona, fill:
- **Role**: Job title or user archetype
- **Goals**: What they want to achieve
- **Pain Points**: Current frustrations
- **Jobs-to-be-Done**:
  - *Functional*: What task are they trying to accomplish?
  - *Emotional*: How do they want to feel?
  - *Social*: How do they want to be perceived?

### 1.3 Feature Breakdown (Epics → Stories)
Organize features into Epics. For each Story within an Epic, score:

| Story | Impact (1-5) | Effort (1-5) | Priority (I/E) |
|-------|:------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|
| ...   | ...          | ...          | ...            |

- **Impact**: User value (how much does it matter?) + Business value (revenue, retention, growth)
- **Effort**: Technical complexity + Risk (unknowns, dependencies)
- **Priority**: Impact ÷ Effort — higher is better

### 1.4 Architecture Design
- Draw a system-level Mermaid architecture diagram
- Identify major components: frontend, backend, database, external services
- Note technology recommendations (not mandates)

### 1.5 Page/Screen Design
For each key screen:
- **Purpose**: What user goal does this screen serve?
- **Components**: UI component hierarchy (header, forms, lists, modals, etc.)
- **User Flow**: Step-by-step interaction sequence
- **shadcn Integration (Conditional)**: IF `components.json` exists in the project root, use `mcp__shadcn__search_items_in_registries` to find matching UI components for each page element. Include the shadcn component names (e.g., `@shadcn/button`, `@shadcn/card`) in the component hierarchy.

### 1.6 API Design
- List endpoints: `METHOD /path → description`
- Define core data models (entity fields and relationships)
- Specify auth strategy (JWT, session, OAuth, API key)

### 1.7 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Response time targets, throughput expectations
- **Security**: Auth model, data encryption, OWASP baseline
- **Scalability**: Expected user load, horizontal vs vertical scaling

### 1.8 Success Metrics
Define measurable KPIs per Epic:

| Epic | Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|------|--------|--------|----------------|
| ...  | ...    | ...    | ...            |

### 1.9 MVP Roadmap (Three-Horizon Framework)
Assign each Story to a horizon:

- **Now (Sprint 1-3)**: Core MVP — must-have features to validate the product
- **Next (Sprint 4-8)**: Differentiation — features that create competitive advantage
- **Later (Sprint 9+)**: Scale — platform expansion, optimization, advanced features

3.  **Write**: Save the completed PRD to `docs/product/prd.md`.

## 🎬 Phase 2: Architecture
1.  **Update HLD**: Write the architecture Mermaid diagram from Section 1.4 into `docs/architecture/graphs/system_design.mmd`.
2.  **Visualize** (if existing code): Run `python3 ~/.claude/skills/pactkit-visualize/scripts/visualize.py visualize`.

## 🎬 Phase 3: Story Decomposition
> **Goal**: Convert PRD Feature Breakdown into individual Specs.

1.  **Determine STORY IDs**: Scan `docs/specs/` to find the next available STORY-NNN number.
2.  **Sort**: Order stories by horizon (Now → Next → Later), then by Priority Score (descending).
3.  **For each Story**:
    - Run `python3 ~/.claude/skills/pactkit-scaffold/scripts/scaffold.py create_spec "STORY-{NNN}" "{title}"`.
    - Fill in the Spec:
      - `## Requirements` — using RFC 2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY)
      - `## Acceptance Criteria` — Given/When/Then scenarios
      - Add Priority Score to the spec header: `- **Priority**: {score} (Impact {I} / Effort {E})`
4.  **Dependency Graph**: Add a Mermaid dependency graph at the end of the PRD showing Story execution order and critical path.

## 🎬 Phase 4: Board Setup
1.  **Add Stories**: For each Story (ordered by horizon → priority):
    - Run `python3 ~/.claude/skills/pactkit-board/scripts/board.py add_story "STORY-{NNN}" "{title}" "{task list}"`.
2.  **Verify**: Read `docs/product/sprint_board.md` to confirm all stories are listed.

## 🎬 Phase 5: Handover
1.  **Summary Table**: Output a table of all created artifacts:

| Artifact | Path | Count |
|----------|------|-------|
| PRD | `docs/product/prd.md` | 1 |
| Specs | `docs/specs/STORY-{NNN}.md` | N |
| Board Entries | `docs/product/sprint_board.md` | N |
| Architecture | `docs/architecture/graphs/system_design.mmd` | 1 |

2.  **Story Overview**: List stories grouped by horizon (Now/Next/Later) with priority scores.
3.  **Handover**: "PRD created. {N} stories ready for `/project-sprint`."

## ⚠️ What This Command Does NOT Do
- Does NOT write implementation code — only PRD, Specs, and architecture design
- Does NOT include market sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM) or pricing strategy — AI cannot produce reliable market data
- Does NOT generate UI wireframe images — page design is text-based component hierarchy
- Does NOT enforce a specific tech stack — recommendations only, not mandates
- Does NOT depend on WebSearch — works entirely from user input
