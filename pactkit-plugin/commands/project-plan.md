# Command: Plan (v19.5 Integrated Trace)
- **Usage**: `/project-plan "$ARGUMENTS"`
- **Agent**: System Architect

## 🧠 Phase 0: The Thinking Process (Mandatory)
> **INSTRUCTION**: Output a `<thinking>` block.
1.  **Analyze Intent**: New feature (Expansion) or Bugfix/Refactor (Modification)?
2.  **Strategy**:
    - If **New Feature**: Focus on `system_design.mmd` (Architecture).
    - If **Modification**: Focus on `/project-trace` (Logic Flow).

## 🛡️ Phase 0.5: Init Guard (Auto-detect)
> **INSTRUCTION**: Check if the project has been initialized before proceeding.
1.  **Check Markers**: Verify the existence of ALL three:
    - `.claude/pactkit.yaml` (project-level config)
    - `docs/product/sprint_board.md` (sprint board)
    - `docs/architecture/graphs/` (architecture graph directory)
2.  **If ANY marker is missing**:
    - Print: "⚠️ Project not initialized. Running `/project-init` first..."
    - Execute the full `/project-init` flow to scaffold the missing structure.
    - After `/project-init` completes, resume this Plan command from Phase 1.
3.  **If ALL markers exist**: Skip silently to Phase 1.

## 🎬 Phase 1: Archaeology (The "Know Before You Change" Step)
1.  **Visual Scan**: Run `visualize` to see the module dependency graph.
    - **Mode Selection**: Use `--mode class` for structure analysis, `--mode call` for logic modification, default for overview.
2.  **Logic Trace (CRITICAL)**:
    - If modifying existing logic, you MUST run:
      `/project-trace "How does [Feature X] currently work?"`
    - *Goal*: Identify the exact function/class responsible for the logic.

## 🎬 Phase 2: Design & Impact
1.  **Diff**: Compare User Request vs Current Reality (from Phase 1).
2.  **Update HLD**: Modify `docs/architecture/graphs/system_design.mmd`.
    - *Rule*: Keep the `code_graph.mmd` as is (it updates automatically).

## 🎬 Phase 3: Deliverables
1.  **Spec**: Create `docs/specs/{ID}.md` detailing the *Change*.
    - *Requirement*: Include a "Target Call Chain" section in the Spec based on your Trace findings.
    - **MUST**: Fill in the `## Requirements` section using RFC 2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MAY).
    - **MUST**: Fill in the `## Acceptance Criteria` section with Given/When/Then scenarios.
    - Each Scenario SHOULD map to a verifiable test case in `docs/test_cases/`.
    - **MUST**: Fill in the `Release` metadata field with the current version from `pactkit.yaml` (or leave `TBD` if unknown).
2.  **Board**: Add Story using `add_story`.
3.  **Memory MCP (Conditional)**: IF `mcp__memory__create_entities` tool is available, store the design context:
    - Use `mcp__memory__create_entities` with: `name: "{STORY_ID}"`, `entityType: "story"`, `observations: [key architectural decisions, target files, design rationale]`
    - IF this story depends on other stories, use `mcp__memory__create_relations` to record dependencies (e.g., `from: "{STORY_ID}", to: "STORY-XXX", relationType: "depends_on"`)
4.  **Handover**: "Trace complete. Spec created. Ready for Act."
